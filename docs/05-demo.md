# Demo Guide

This branch serves a public demo of Fillakit. It showcases:

- Filament dashboard with example widgets
- Tech stack overview (auto-read from composer)
- Quick links to docs and GitHub

## No Database Mode

The dashboard widgets are designed to work without a database connection. If DB is not configured, the widget gracefully shows `No database`.

For in-memory data models, consider using Sushi by Caleb Porzio. It lets you define Eloquent-like models backed by arrays. See: `https://usesushi.dev/`.
